## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (version >= 18.x recommended)
*   npm or yarn (npm is typically installed with Node.js)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/thegiftlist.git
    ```
    *(Replace `https://github.com/your-username/thegiftlist.git` with the actual repository URL when available)*

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd thegiftlist
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    Using npm:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    Or using yarn:
    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

### Running the Development Server

To start the development server:

Using npm:
```bash
npm run dev
```
Or using yarn:
```bash
yarn dev
```
This will typically start the Vite development server and open the application in your default web browser at `http://localhost:5173`.

### Building for Production

To create a production-ready build of the application:

Using npm:
```bash
npm run build
```
Or using yarn:
```bash
yarn build
```
This command bundles the application and outputs the static files to a `dist` folder in the project root.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following scripts:

*   `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`:
    Starts the development server with Hot Module Replacement (HMR).

*   `npm run build` or `yarn build`:
    Bundles the app into static files for production, located in the `dist` directory.

*   `npm run preview` or `yarn preview`:
    Serves the production build locally to preview the application as it would appear in a production environment.

*   `npm run start` or `yarn start`:
    An alias for `preview`, often used by deployment platforms to serve the production build.

## Project Structure

The project follows a standard Vite and React application structure:

```
thegiftlist/
├── public/               # Static assets (images, fonts, etc.)
├── src/                  # Main application source code
│   ├── components/       # Reusable UI components (Header, Footer, Buttons, etc.)
│   ├── pages/            # Top-level page components (Home, About, Login, Signup, etc.)
│   ├── styles/           # Global styles, CSS variables, and utility classes
│   ├── App.jsx           # Main application component, defines routes and layout
│   └── main.jsx          # Entry point of the React application
├── .gitignore            # Specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore
├── index.html            # The HTML template for the application
├── package.json          # Project metadata, dependencies, and scripts
├── vite.config.js        # Vite configuration file
└── README.md             # This file
```

*   **`public/`**: Contains static assets that are directly served.
*   **`src/`**: Contains all the React components, pages, styles, and application logic.
    *   **`components/`**: Houses reusable UI elements that are used across multiple pages.
    *   **`pages/`**: Contains components that represent entire pages of the application (e.g., Home, Login, UserProfile).
    *   **`styles/`**: Includes global stylesheets, CSS reset/normalize, and potentially theme files.
    *   **`App.jsx`**: The root component of the React application, typically responsible for setting up routing and global context.
    *   **`main.jsx`**: The JavaScript entry point that renders the `App` component into the DOM.
*   **`vite.config.js`**: Configuration file for Vite, allowing customization of the build process and development server.
*   **`package.json`**: Lists project dependencies, scripts for development and building, and other metadata.
